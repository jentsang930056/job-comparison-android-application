### My accomplishments for this deliverable:

- Finished the first round of tests for checking the app's user interface and database. Made sure everything looks good and works right.
- Debugged some test code issues after other part of the code was merged.
- Discussed with the design team about making the app look and work better. 
- Cleared up any misunderstandings within our team. This helped make sure everyone understands what to do.
- Updated our testing plans on TestPlan.md with the new results and added more tests we need to do next.
