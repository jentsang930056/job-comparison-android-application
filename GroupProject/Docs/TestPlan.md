# Test Plan

**Author**: Team051

## 1 Testing Strategy


### 1.1 Overall strategy

This testing strategy covers unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and regression testing.

- Unit Testing: Developers will test each component of the application independently using JUnit.
- Integration Testing: Following unit testing developers will assess how different components integrate to ensure operation.
- System Testing: The entire system will undergo testing to validate that it fulfills the specified requirements. Details can be found in the requirement document. Individuals, outside the development team will handle this task.
- Regression Testing: In case of any app modifications all team members will conduct regression tests to verify that new changes do not disrupt existing functionalities.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We will select test cases using a combination of black-box and white-box testing techniques:

- **Black-Box Testing**: We will use equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis to select test cases based on the functional requirements.

- **White-Box Testing**: We will use statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage to ensure the testing of the internal logic.

Different techniques will be used for different testing levels:

- For **Unit Testing**: Primarily white-box testing techniques.
- For **System Testing**: Mainly black-box testing techniques.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The Adequacy Criterion will be assessed using the following criteria:

- **Unit Testing**: 100% statement and branch coverage are ideal.
- **Integration and System Testing**: Functional coverage will be assessed based on requirement specifications. Each requirement will be mapped to at least one test case to ensure complete coverage.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked using Github Issues. Each bug will be logged with a description, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and status showing if it is fixed or not.

### 1.5 Technology

JUnit and Espresso will be used for testing.
